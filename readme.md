# Readme
**Please note, because of the absence of the possibility to give a seed to the template module from the Checklist Editor package, the results may vary from the results outputted by running the notebook can differ slightly from the results as described in the report.**

## How to run the code
- Install required packages (found in requirements.txt)
- Per ability, walk through the notebook, the notebooks provide a deeper insight into the behaviour of the different SRL Models and the interpretability of their output.
- The notebooks offer some, but limited, insight into the output. All results are stored in the [results](/results) folder.

## It is also possible to skip the running of the code and look at the results of running various experiments. 
To run the experiments, [datasets](/datasets) were created using the CheckList module. Two SRL-prediction models were run on these datasets and produced the [results](/results).
